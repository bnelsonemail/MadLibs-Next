# MadLibs Magic — Premium Preview ✨
*A fun + grown-up approach to creating chaos with words.*

## 🎉 Welcome to the Future of MadLibs Magic!
MadLibs should feel wild, goofy, creative, and occasionally unhinged.
Premium takes that energy and says: “Yes. MORE.”

This is a real upgrade, carefully built by an actual developer, designed to make
MadLib creation faster, easier, and way more fun.
